###src/test
--------------------------

All end to end tests go in their corresponding module/feature/etc. However, for Protractor (e2e) tests 'helper' files can defined here for reusability. They just need to have the following filename format: `<name>.protractor.js`

See `helpers.protractor.js` to get a better idea of what methods these helper files can contain.
